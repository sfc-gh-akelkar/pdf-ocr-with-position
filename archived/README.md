# Archived: Streamlit App

## Why Archived?

The Streamlit PDF viewer app has been **shelved until Phase 6** is complete.

### Reason:
- Current app only demonstrates keyword search (fancy Ctrl+F)
- Real value comes from **Phase 6: Semantic Search + LLM Q&A**
- Without semantic intelligence, the app doesn't justify the complexity

### What's Here:
- `streamlit_pdf_viewer.py` - The demo app
- `STREAMLIT_APP.md` - Setup documentation

### When to Bring Back:

**After Phase 6 is complete**, the app will demonstrate:
- ✅ Semantic search (not just keywords)
- ✅ LLM question answering
- ✅ Intelligent citations with visual highlights
- ✅ **Real business value**

Then it becomes a powerful demo tool worth the investment.

### To Use (After Phase 6):
```bash
# Move back to main directory
mv archived/streamlit_pdf_viewer.py .
mv archived/STREAMLIT_APP.md .

# Update and deploy
streamlit run streamlit_pdf_viewer.py
```

**Focus now: Get to Phase 6!** 🎯
